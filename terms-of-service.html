        <h3>2.2. User-Generated Content (Prompts)</h3>
        <p>You are solely responsible for the text prompts you input into the Service. You agree not to input any content that:</p>

        <p>We do not store your text prompts or generated images on our servers after the generation process is complete and the images are delivered to your browser.</p>

        <h3>2.3. Generated Images</h3>
        <p>The images generated by the AI are based on the prompts you provide. While we strive for appropriate content, we cannot guarantee that all generated images will be free from unintended or objectionable content.
